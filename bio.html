          <em>“How do new things get built?”</em> After reading

            Leonardo Da Vinci’s biography
          </a>
          as a freshman, I decided that the best inventions are created by
          people who work across multiple disciplines. If you notice that my
          experiences seem somewhat unrelated, it is Da Vinci's fault!

          <p>
            In college, I studied Finance to understand how businesses work and
            Information Systems to learn how to build with the modern tech
            stack. My education taught me how money, data, and software flow
            through businesses.
            <br /><br />On campus I competed in VC case competitions, interned
            at two Series A startups and an investment fund, and I founded a
            200-member investment club to help students learn to invest early.
            <br />
            <br />
            The club's Discord community exchanged analysis on markets and
            economic events.

          <h2>Technology Consulting at Riveron</h2>
          <p>
            I went into consulting to get rapid exposure to different operating
            scenarios and build skills quickly. <br /><br />As a consultant, I
            implemented ERPs (mostly NetSuite) for mid-market firms: conducted
            on-site interviews to map processes, configured ERP environments to
            match operational needs, and delivered UAT sessions with
            step-by-step documentation for post-go-live self-sufficiency.<br />
            <br />I also built ARR Snowball and general operations dashboards
            for clients, performing end-to-end ETL flows (SQL, Alteryx) and
            passing them through to Power BI—helping clients improve
            ARR-reporting accuracy by 20%. <br /><br />For both types of
            engageemnts, I worked in PowerPoint and Excel a lot.<br /><br />Rotating
            across industries showed me the patterns that separate smooth
            internal ops from chaotic ones.

          <p>
            Craving more ownership, I co-founded
            <strong>Haha Productions</strong> in Austin, TX. I turned a
            100-person backyard comedy show into monthly shows at professional
            venues including an 800-person flagship show. I led social-media
            strategy that earned 5M+ views and thousands of followers. My role
            spans talent procurement, backoffice operations, social media
            management, and handled end-to-end tasks.<br /><br />It has been
            deeply rewarding to get familiar with the comedy scene in Austin and
            build something of my own.

            is a passion project. I've always been interested in history, so I
            chose to build a website that makes learning about it as enjoyable
            as possible.

          So far I have learned how to:

          <ul>
            <li>Buy a domain</li>
            <li>Use an IDE (VS Code)</li>
            <li>Write code in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</li>
            <li>Use Git and GitHub for version control</li>
            <li>Deploy to a cloud server (Vercel)</li>
            <li>Integrate LLMs via the ChatGPT API</li>
            <li>Test API endpoints with Postman</li>
            <li>Connect frontend + backend with Node.js &amp; Express</li>
            <li>Attach a database (MongoDB)</li>
            <li>Automate database population</li>
            <li>
              Embed an LLM in workflows using MCP to create novel tech (e.g.,
              generate maps by scanning text)
            </li>
            <li>... much more</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            <br /><br />
            The MVP is live and gathering feedback from educators and hobbyists.

          <h2>What I’m After Next</h2>
          <p>
            I’m looking for a role where I can own a product front-to-back:
            grasp the codebase, know the unit economics, talk to customers
            weekly, and turn those insights into roadmap wins.
            <br /><br />I want to keep sharpening my customer-facing skills
            while deepening my technical fluency—because the better I understand
            both, the faster I can build products that simplify complexity and
            spark genuine joy.
